Event Management App using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). Used Visual Studio Code as our local development environment. Created routes, defined models, connected to a database, and created the frontend with React components. Using with for a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for hosting events, allowing users to host events using a button and see posted events and be able to join events using a button and where the join button counts clicks in increments on click evetime a user joins.

# Unsolved Problems:

The join button counts clicks in increments on click evetime a user joins an event

# Future Enhancements:

-Addvanced CSS Styling 

-A way for the User to unjoin if he/she changes their mind after joining 

-Two different sign-in/log-in for prespective      users; 
    ~ one for Users that only want to join an event
    ~ another for Users who want to create events 
 
 So that a User that did not create an event will not be able to delete an event only the user who created it can delete an event he/she created. 

 -A way the creater can see the a list of User that joined his/her created event

 -Different Tab's for different event types (i.e. sports, reading, writing, networking e.t.c.)

 -Background checks 

 -Tabs for different locations (i.e. States, Cities, Countires)

 -Different language opitions for the page for the user 

 -Being able to Search events by Catogory, location e.t.c 

 -Adding a limmit that can join to an event

 -Adding a rating system for the users for an event

 -Adding a chat for the user to communicate

 -Additing a real email verification and password gauge so that a user can create more complex PW

 -When joining taking the user to a different page where the user can interact more (i.e. getting email reminders for upcoming event or even a msg through the app or text)

 -Add a test commonent
